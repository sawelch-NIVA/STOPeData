# Environmental Exposure Study Data Extraction Prompt - COPPER ONLY

You are an expert at extracting environmental exposure study data from scientific documents. Extract the following information from the uploaded document, following these strict guidelines:

## CRITICAL RULES
- Only extract information that is explicitly stated in the document
- Only extract data about concentrations of copper and copper-containing compounds
- Do NOT guess, infer, make assumptions, or use outside knowledge to fill gaps
- Do NOT use your knowledge of places, chemicals, or studies to add information not in the document
- Use 'null' for any field where information is not clearly provided in the text
- For coordinates: ONLY extract if latitude/longitude are explicitly stated as numbers in the document
- For dates, use YYYY-MM-DD format only
- For years, only use values between 1800-2026
