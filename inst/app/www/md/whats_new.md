- Added the ability to download and upload your current progress as a zipped set of CSV files at any time. Currently this is limited to **validated data,** which is not ideal if you're working with a big dataset that takes a long time to validate.
  - I hope to fix this over the next few days, but I'd appreciate if you could test the current functionality and let me know if you encounter any issues.
  - If you want to open the file and inspect the CSVs, you can do this. You can also edit them in Excel before reuploading, although this is known to cause issues with formating so beware.
- Aquatic Sediment is now properly available as a subcompartment.
- w/w dry weight units (both conventional SI and ppm/ppb/etc.) can now be selected as options
- Units and controlled vocabulary lists have been moved to a centralised, harmonised file. This may affect performance, please let me know if anything seems slower than previously.
