- Changed all internal data formats to use `tibble()` rather than `list()`). This isn't very exciting from an end user perspective, but enables:
- Added the ability to download and upload your current progress as a zipped set of CSV files at any time. If you want to open the file and inspect the CSVs, you can do this. You can also edit them in Excel before reuploading. I tend to bounce between the app and Excel based on the sort of data I'm inputting.
- Aquatic Sediment is now properly available as a subcompartment.
- w/w dry weight and wet weight units (both conventional SI and ppm/ppb/etc.) can now be selected as options.
- When adding sites from the map you can now choose what precision to report coordinates at.
- Sample REPLICATE has been changed to SUBSAMPLE and now takes text values. This allows splitting samples into e.g. different sediment core depths
- EXPERIMENTAL: As part of the extraction process the LLM now scores the paper and its job extracting data from it. I don't know how effective this is, but I'd be interested to hear all your experiences with it.
- MEASURED_SD has been replaced with UNCERTAINTY_TYPE, UNCERTAINTY_UPPER, UNCERTAINTY_LOWER and MEASURED_N, which allow more precise reporting of uncertainty.
