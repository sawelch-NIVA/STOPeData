- Enter detailed biological information for samples from living organisms.
- All biota samples require species identification, tissue type, life stage, and
  gender information to be considered valid.
- In cases where biodiversity indices are reported, use the Species Group "Ecosystem".
- Species not in the database can be added manually in the table, but please check if they are synonyms beforehand.
- I've kept tissue types and life stage options intentionally short to avoid impractically large dropdowns. Mark as Other and add a comment if needed.
- Additional comments judged relevant to biota can also be added.
