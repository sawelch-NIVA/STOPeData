- Sampling, fractionation, extraction, and analytical protocols can affect
  ultimate measured concentrations by order of magnitude.
- Please report the relevant protocol types/classes here. In the Data module,
  you will be able to match specific protocols to samples.
- LLM extraction is particularly bad at matching protocols to categories. Please exercise caution when validating results.
