- Sampling, fractionation, extraction, and analytical protocols can affect
  ultimate measured concentrations by order of magnitude.
- Please report the relevant protocol types/classes here. In the Measurements module,
  you will be able to match specific protocols to samples.
- What's the exact difference between extraction and fractionation? It's not entirely clear to me, and different papers use different language. Methods may also report a series of techniques that don't fit well into a single protocol option. I am open to suggestions and constructive criticism here.
- LLM extraction is particularly bad at matching protocols to categories. Please exercise caution when validating results.
