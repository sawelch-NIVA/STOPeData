This module provides a Criteria for Reporting and Evaluating Exposure Datasets
(CREED) assessment (version 1), based on [Di Paolo *et al.*,
2024.](https://academic.oup.com/ieam/article/20/4/1019/7821760) The Dataset
Details section summarizes key characteristics of your dataset that are relevant
for quality evaluation. Fields are auto-populated where possible from your
imported data. **This module is currently hardcoded for exposure assessment of copper, 
and the data summarised may not be relevant for other pollutants (especially non-metals).**

The CREED assessment process assumes that exposure data are being assessed in
the context of a broader chemical/ecological assessment, and thus not all
criteria will necessarily be relevant to you the user's needs. In this case, you
are encouraged to record this in the relevant fields.

CREED assigns a dataset Gold status if all Recommended criteria (11 reliability,
4 relevance) are met, or Silver status if all Required criteria (7 reliability,
7 relevance are met). Once you complete this module, you will be able to mark
your dataset as Gold or Silver if it meets appropriate criteria.
