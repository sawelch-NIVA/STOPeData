- Create sample combinations by selecting sites, parameters, compartments, and
  sampling dates.
- Each combination represents a specific sample that will be collected. Select
  multiple values from each category to generate all possible combinations.
- In cases where the water column or sediment cores are sampled to multiple depths or sampled and then analysed at multiple depths, use the SUBSAMPLE field to split samples
