- Create sample combinations by selecting sites, parameters, compartments, and
  sampling dates.
- Each combination represents a specific sample that will be collected. Select
  multiple values from each category to generate all possible combinations.
- In cases where samples need to be further split, use the SUBSAMPLE field to split samples. For example *5cm, 10cm, 15cm* ; *trout liver, trout kidney, salmon liver, salmon kidney*; etc.
