- Enter environmental compartment combinations that will be sampled. Select an
  environmental compartment (e.g., Aquatic), then choose the appropriate
  sub-compartment (e.g., Freshwater) and measurement category (e.g. inside an organism, on the surface of an organism, or in the external environment).
- Each combination represents a different sampling context used in the study or
  dataset. If there really isn't a good option for your reported compartment, mark it as "Other" and let me know.
- For biota, use the compartment they reproduce in. This is potentially a little ambiguous, but I interpret it as follows:
  - Aquatic: Fish, cetaceans, marine amphibians, etc.
  - Terrestrial: All land animals, birds (inc. penguins and seabirds), pinnipeds, etc.
  - Atmospheric: Maybe some bacteria? You are unlikely to need this category.
  - Other: Included just in case I have missed something obvious.
- This is probably one of the most conceptually confusing parts of the workflow,
  so please let me know if you have any clever ideas to tweak it!
