- Enter environmental compartment combinations that will be sampled. Select an
  environmental compartment (e.g., Aquatic), then choose the appropriate
  sub-compartment (e.g., Freshwater) and measurement category. 
- Each combination represents a different sampling context used in the study or
  dataset.
- This is probably one of the most conceptually confusing parts of the workflow,
  so please let me know if you have any clever ideas to tweak it!
