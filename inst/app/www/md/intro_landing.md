Since this app is exclusively being used for EXPECT's AEP copper data extraction right now, I'm writing these instructions for myself, Pierre, Camden, Li, Knut Erik, and anyone else I've roped in to help with data extraction.

###### Some tips:

1. [Paper list here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tq2vd6-Cwzh93O8prHdXuML0cgBU1mbR9l7Ka_u70BE/edit?gid=1566526983#gid=1566526983). Columns should be self-explanatory.
2. Save extractions (ongoing and completed) on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/19PsBm-B5tsA54MKJ0xNJW3n1vhSoeXxR) so others can take over if needed.
3. Use Download All frequently. The app is stable, but this prevents lost work.
4. Check for Supplementary Information/Supporting Information (ESI) first. If it contains raw data tables, [merge it with the main PDF](https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) before uploading.
5. Use two screens - one for the app, one for the paper. Some UI elements need wider screens.
6. You can work in Excel if easier, but use the controlled vocabulary.

If something breaks, email saw@niva.no or log an issue [here](https://github.com/sawelch-NIVA/STOPeData/issues) with screenshots and your extraction file.
