Hello and welcome to my latest attempt to get a working Shiny app to help you
extract, format, and explore exposure data.

This app is organised as a series of modules intended to be completed sequentially,
before exploring then exporting the data. Optionally, you can also complete a CREED
assessment using the Quality tab.

Data can be entered manually or with LLM assistance. First you enter metadata on
the context, sampling Sites, stressors/quality Parameters, Compartments, and Methods of your study. 
Then you select valid combinations of these in the Samples module, before adding
any relevant information on Biota, and actual measured Data. 

Instructions and tooltips are available on each page.
