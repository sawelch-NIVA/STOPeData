Hello and welcome to my latest attempt to get a working Shiny app to help you extract, format, and explore exposure data. Working with exposure data can be confusing, slow, and complicated, but the aim is to make the process as easy, reproducible, and error free as possible.

This app is organised as a series of modules intended to be completed sequentially, before exploring then exporting the data. Optionally, you can also complete a CREED assessment using the Quality tab.

Data can be entered manually or with LLM assistance. First you enter metadata on the context, sampling Sites, stressors/quality Parameters, Compartments, and Methods of your study. Then you select valid combinations of these in the Samples module, before adding any relevant information on Biota, and actual measured Data.
