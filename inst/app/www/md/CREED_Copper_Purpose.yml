study_purpose: |
  Assessment of concentrations of copper in biota and environmental media in the Arctic and near-Arctic, covering the last century. No minimum of monitoring period, site density, or sampling approach has selected. The goal is to build a rough, conceptual but weight-of-evidence-based Aggregate Exposure Pathway (i.e. network diagram of sources, sinks, and fluxes) for copper occurence and exposure to wildlife in the study region.

      notes: |
        Although interpreting copper concentrations in both biota and environmental compartments requires 
        an assessment of geochemistry/biochemistry, this assessment is foregoing an in-depth exploration 
        of these factors to reduce scope.
