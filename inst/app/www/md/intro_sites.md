- Enter sampling site information. The 'Area' field is ideal for sites in international waters.
- Add blank sites by clicking 'Add Site(s)' below, or selecting a point on the map (right) and clicking 'Add'. Use an appropriate level of precision based on the source data - 3 d.p. (within 111 m) or 4 d.p. (within 11 m) may be most appropriate.
- Edit fields directly in the table. Use the map to verify coordinates are
  correct.
- Sites added via the table will appear on the map, and the inverse.
- Delete uneeded rows with the right-click menu, and use the blue handle in the
  bottom right of a selected cell to copy its contents to another cell (just
  like Excel!)
- Click the *Expand* icon in the bottom-right of the map and table panels to view them in full screen
