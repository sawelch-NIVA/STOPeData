This module manages sampling site information.
Add sites by clicking 'Add Site(s)' which creates editable rows in the table.Edit fields directly in the table. Use the map to verify coordinates are correct. Delete uneeded rows with the right-click menu, and use the blue handle in the bottom right of a selected cell to copy its contents to another cell (just like Excel!)
