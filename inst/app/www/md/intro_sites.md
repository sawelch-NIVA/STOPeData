This module manages sampling site information.
Add sites by clicking 'Add Site(s)' which creates editable rows in the table.Edit fields directly in the table. Use the map to verify coordinates are correct.
On narrower screens the table will sometimes fail to render. Use the Full Screen buttons at the bottom right of each card.
