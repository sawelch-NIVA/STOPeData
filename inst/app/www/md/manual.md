# FAQ

###### Something's gone wrong with the extraction!
Extraction reporting currently isn't very good. Check your internet connection, whether your PDF is corrupted, and if the Claude service [is up](https://status.claude.com/). If the Raw Data Extraction is showing a lot of `NULL` and `NA` values, this may mean that the paper is too big for the extraction token limit (how much information the LLM can take on at one time). Let me know if that's the case.

###### I can't find the unit/organism/compartment/etc. I need!
Use the most appropriate available option for now, and let me know.

###### Why can we extract sites, parameter, campaign, etc. data but not actual measurements?
This is something I'm working on, but it's harder than simple data like the above. 

###### A module is showing that my data isn't validated, but I think it is.
Send me a screenshot + a copy of your files.

###### The screen has gone grey/the app has crashed.
My mistake! But I'm very interested in hearing how this happened and what you were doing when it did. Please let me know ASAP.

###### Methods or protocols?
I'm not really sure. It seems there are methods, protocols and techniques. LibreTexts Chemistry says:
> A technique is any chemical or physical principle that we can use to study an analyte
> A method is the application of a technique for a specific analyte in a specific matrix.
> A procedure is a set of written directions that tell us how to apply a method to a particular sample.
> Finally, a protocol is a set of stringent guidelines that specify a procedure that an analyst must follow if an agency is to accept the results.

So I am certainly using the term "protocol" wrong here. But I haven't reworked this section yet because, frankly, I don't know who will be using the app. But I'm open to input.
