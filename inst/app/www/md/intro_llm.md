This module uses the Claude Large Language Model (current Sonnet 4, last updated 14th May 2025) to automatically extract environmental exposure data from uploaded PDFs. Upload a research paper or report, provide your Anthropic API key (note that this requires an Anthropic developer account, which is not the same as a subscription to Claude), and the system will attempt to populate all form fields automatically. 
LLMs can and do make mistakes including hallucinating information that is not present in the source document, so please carefully review and correct the extracted data in subsequent modules before validation.
